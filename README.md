construct
=========

Construct is one of the first Template Development Frameworks for the Joomla! CMS. Originally developed in late 2007, with an initial limited release in January of 2008, Construct has grown to three versions during the evolution of Joomla.

Stable Master Branch Policy
====================
The master branch will, at all times, remain stable. Development for new features will occur in branches, and when ready, will be merged into the master branch. Regular development and maintenance occurs in the [develop](https://github.com/construct-framework/construct/tree/develop) branch.

In the event features have already been merged for the next release series, and an issue arises that warrants a fix on the current release series, the developer will create a branch based off the tag created from the previous release, make the necessary changes, package a new release, and tag the new release. If necessary, the commits made in the temporary branch will be merged into master.
